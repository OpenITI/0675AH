    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): Corrected levelling of the headers. Fixed the
    numbers of the chapters that were wrong. 2- some chapters (qism) are obviously
    subsections of other qisms (like qisms 6, 7, 8 that are subsections of the 5th
    qism). However, I kept all the qisms as first-level to keep the levelling of the
    author. 3- Page 5 (the author’s introduction) is missing.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
