90#VERS#COMMENT##: Couldn't find a pdf version, so worked with the printed edition in AKU-ISMC library. 
 Pagination is correct and paragraphs usually are as well.  There are footnote markers in the text, and html-hyperlinks to Quranic citations. 
 From the end of the second volume onwards the typist didn't write all section markers for asl and sharh and did not mark
 some such headers between square brackets, so I have tended to correct these to improve logical text structure. Poetry has not been formatted. In volume three some of 
 headers in square brackets differ from those used in the pdf-edition, although they refer to the same subjects. At the start of each volume the typist
 has copied some editorial data. I have used the editor tag to distinguish this, and followed it by an empty header tag to denote where the text picks up again.
 Numbering of sections is inconsistent both in being actually numbered and in whether Arabic or Latin numerals are used -- I have not corrected this.
