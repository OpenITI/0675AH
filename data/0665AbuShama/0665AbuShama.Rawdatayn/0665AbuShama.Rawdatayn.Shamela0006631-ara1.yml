    See, `README.md` for details.
    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): Headers that were not aligned in one line corrected.
    PARATEXT added. Removed a part of PageV03P024 which was duplicate. 2- The fourth
    volume is completely different from the PDF. The text is the same, but
    pagination differs and the headers in the PDF are removed. I couldn’t understand
    why this happens. It doesn’t seem to be a different edition, maybe the digital
    version is an older or newer reprint. 3- A different edition is accessible here:
    https://ketabpedia.com/%D8%AA%D8%AD%D9%85%D9%8A%D9%84/%D8%B9%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B6%D8%AA%D9%8A%D9%86-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D8%AE%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%8A%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%88%D8%B1/
